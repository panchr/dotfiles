# Rushyâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/config/dotfiles`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panchr/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && bootstrap/init.sh
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae. This will install Homebrew and some standard packages:

```bash
./bootstrap/install-packages.sh
```

## Original

This is forked from the original https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.
