{"id":"dotfiles-2l8","title":"Add command for simplifying CLAUDE.md","description":"Add a slash command that analyzes and simplifies CLAUDE.md files (both global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and project-level). The command should:\n\n1. Read the target CLAUDE.md file(s)\n2. Identify redundancies: instructions that duplicate Claude's default behavior, overly verbose explanations, repeated concepts across sections\n3. Identify conflicts: instructions that contradict each other or contradict defaults\n4. Identify dead weight: instructions about features/patterns no longer in use, references to nonexistent files or tools\n5. Suggest a simplified version that preserves all meaningful intent in fewer lines\n6. Present a diff of proposed changes for user approval before applying\n7. Support --dry-run to show suggestions without modifying anything\n\nGoal: keep CLAUDE.md files concise and high-signal. Lines after 200 in memory files get truncated, and verbose instructions waste context window. Every line should earn its place.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"panchal.rushy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-25T06:23:23.317232-06:00","created_by":"Rushy Panchal","updated_at":"2026-02-25T06:27:23.155457-06:00"}

API surface: overly broad interfaces, leaky abstractions, inconsistent API patterns across the codebase\n4. Code organization: files in wrong directories, inconsistent naming across modules, orphaned/dead code paths\n5. Design pattern usage: misapplied patterns, opportunities for well-established patterns that would reduce complexity\n\nFor each finding, provide: the issue, why it matters for maintainability, and a concrete refactoring suggestion.\n\nImplementation: create a new agent definition in claude/agents/ following the existing pattern (YAML frontmatter, tools: Read/Grep/Glob/Bash).
